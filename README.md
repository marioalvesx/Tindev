A social network for devs :)

- Application web and mobile created using one of the most powerfull stacks currently.
- Created for the purpose of study the stack: NodeJS, React and React Native.
- I do not recommend the comercial use of this application, remembering that it's development is only to reasons of particular studies.

## How to use Tindev?

- [x] Enter your Github user;
- [x] Search for the others developers that logged in the Tindev app too.
- [x] Like or dislike the devs that you see!
- [x] When you like a dev that like you too, IT'S A MATCH! 

- Then, you and your liked dev will received a notification just like these :point_down: 
- Then, go code together!
